### Tribex's Unsorted Projects
* A collection of random one-third-complete projects that I want to have backed up but don't have time to finish expediently. *

#### Projects:
* Muon - A declarative HTML5 component registration library with support for Shadow DOM and Ractive.js templates. (Kind of like Polymer)
* Shadowify - Converts icon fonts to pierce the Shadow DOM. Only tested with FontAwesome and Ionic so far, and I can't say it works very well. Regexes are not a robust CSS parsing solution.
