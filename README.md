### Tribex's Unsorted Projects
*A collection of random one-third-complete projects that I want to have backed up but don't have time to finish expediently.*

#### Projects:
* Muon - A declarative HTML5 component registration library with support for Shadow DOM and Ractive.js templates. (Kind of like Polymer)
* Muon Elements - A few elements created with muon to test and expand its capabilities. Some could actually be pretty useful, like stylable svgs and shadowify fonts.
* Shadowify - Converts icon fonts to pierce the Shadow DOM. Only tested with FontAwesome and Ionic so far, and I can't say it works very well. Regexes are not a robust CSS parsing solution.
* Noted - An (incredibly) poorly-coded (seriously, please don't look at the code) experiment for drawing/taking notes on web pages. Currently very basic and experimental. Will break/break on quite a few sites. (Including GitHub)
