### Tribex's Unsorted Projects
*A collection of random one-third-complete projects that I want to have backed up but don't have time to finish expediently.*

#### Projects:
* Muon - Moved to [its own repository](https://github.com/Tribex/Muon).
* Muon Elements - Moved to [its own repository](https://github.com/Tribex/Muon-Elements).
* Shadowify - Converts icon fonts to pierce the Shadow DOM. Only tested with FontAwesome and Ionic so far, and I can't say it works very well. Regexes are not a robust CSS parsing solution.
* Noted - An (incredibly) poorly-coded (seriously, please don't look at the code) experiment for drawing/taking notes on web pages. Currently very basic and experimental. Will break/break on quite a few sites. (Including GitHub)
